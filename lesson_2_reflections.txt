What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	After doing git init, a new folder named .git gets created. We need to do
	it so that it can start tracking the history of files across commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area stores all the files which we add, and want to add in the next
	commit. Whereas, the working directory is the current directory, and the
	repository contains all the files, and other directories, which may or may
	not be in the staging area.
