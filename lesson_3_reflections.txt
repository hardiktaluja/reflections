When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    So that others can also make changes to our repository, and also, we can
    access our files anywhere.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if many people are working on a same project, then it is possible
	that the commits added by other people, might not always be relevant to be
	added to the original work. So, it should be done manually to ensure only
	the actual owner can approve changes, and not everyone.
