When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    So that others can also make changes to our repository, and also, we can
    access our files anywhere.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if many people are working on a same project, then it is possible
	that the commits added by other people, might not always be relevant to be
	added to the original work. So, it should be done manually to ensure only
	the actual owner can approve changes, and not everyone.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork is used when we want to make some changes to some repository, but we
	don't have permission to do so. It creates same repository in our account.
	Cloning means copying the repository to our local machine, so that we can
	make changes. Branch is used when we want to try something new that we are
	not so sure of. So, we can create a new branch and try the changes. If it
	gets completed without any errors, we can just merge the branch with the
	master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	So that we can see the changes made after the last known state by other
	people. And we can see them even without internet access, because they will
	be stored locally. Also, we can	merge them to our local master, and push
	the changes when we are again connected to the internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	It would be really difficult to collaborate without GitHub, as every person
	in the team will have to be present physically to tell what changes need to
	be made. Nothing would be easier.
